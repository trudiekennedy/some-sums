# Some Sums
A personal project for my youngest niece who keeps on asking me to fire random arithmetic questions at her so she can show off what she's been learning at school.
Figured I would try and make it easier on myself & create something that will do the questions (and the answers!) for me instead of me trying to work it all out.

Unlike my niece, quick-fire arithmetic was never my strong-suit.

# Inventory 
This script, main.py, is a simple quiz that asks 5 arithmetic questions per round. The user can define the number of rounds they want to play.
The addition and subtraction questions are based on numbers up to 100.
The multiplication and division questions go up to the 12-times table. 

## Installation
To use this script, you will need Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website.


## Usage
To use the script, simply run it from the command line using the following command:

`main.py`
